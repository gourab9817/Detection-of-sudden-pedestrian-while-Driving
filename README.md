#INTRODUCTION


The Pedestrian Identification for Excellence Driving System (PIEDS) is a cutting-edge automotive 
safety and traffic management solution that leverages advanced technologies to enhance pedestrian 
safety and overall driving experience. PIEDS is designed to address the critical need for improved 
safety measures in modern urban environments, where pedestrian-vehicle interactions are 
commonplace.


#ABSTRACT


The project, titled "Detection of Sudden Pedestrian Crossing for Driving Assistance System," aims 
to address the critical need for an efficient and cost-effective driving assistance system capable of 
promptly detecting pedestrians within a car-mounted camera's field of view. This system employs 
a combination of computer vision, machine learning, and sensor technologies to identify and 
track pedestrians in real-time. The primary objective is to ensure early identification of 
pedestrians, even when only partially visible, thereby allowing drivers ample time to react. 
Additionally, the project focuses on minimizing false alarms, ensuring the reliable identification 
of genuine pedestrian crossings, and enabling real-time processing for swift driver alerts and 
potential automated vehicle responses.

To achieve these objectives, the system integrates a range of components, including the Arduino 
Uno, L293D motor driver or Arduino Ubi Shield, ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, Raspberry Pi 3, 
and a Raspberry Pi camera. The process initiates with pedestrian detection using the ultrasonic 
sensor and Raspberry Pi camera. The Arduino Uno processes and analyzes the collected data, while 
the Raspberry Pi 3, with support from the camera, performs image processing to detect pedestrians. 
Functioning as the decision-maker, the Raspberry Pi 3 processes data from Arduino Uno and image 
analysis to determine potential pedestrian crossings. It achieves this by accurately detecting 
pedestrians, predicting their movements, and providing drivers with timely alerts.
Simultaneously, the system utilizes visual or auditory cues to alert the driver, ensuring heightened 
awareness and preparedness to assume control if necessary.

A crucial element in the project's success is the utilization of OpenCV, an open-source computer 
vision library. OpenCV provides essential tools for image and video processing, encompassing 
computer vision algorithms, machine learning techniques, and image analysis.
Key hardware components, including Arduino Uno, L293D motor driver or Arduino Ubi Shield, 
ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, Raspberry Pi 3 with a Raspberry camera, Arduino cable, and 
Bluetooth module, work in tandem to create a comprehensive driving assistance system. Software 
components, such as Arduino IDE, Raspberry Pi Imager, Real VNC viewer, Git & Github, and 
Tinkercad, contribute to the seamless integration of the system.
